# ch-qa-opb
This is a bash script that opens a url in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari private windows on a Mac. 

To use the script, open your terminal and cd into the directory you saved it in. Then run "chmod +x ./opb.sh". 

After you've done that, you should be able to simply type the filename in the terminal to run it. 

Enter the url without quotes when prompted.
