# ch-qa-opb
This is a bash script that opens a url in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari private windows on a Mac. 

To use the script, cd into the directory you saved it in. Then run "chmod +x ./<filename>". (Replace <filename> with the name of the file, which should look something like opb.sh).

After you've done that, you should be able to simply type the filename in the terminal to run it. 

Enter the url without quotes when prompted.
